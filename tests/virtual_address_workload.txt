# Virtual Address Access Log (Conceptual)
# Purpose: Demonstrate expected virtual-to-physical translation behavior

Process 1:
Virtual Address: 0x0040
Page Number: 1
Offset: 64
Page Table Hit → Physical Frame 5
Physical Address: Frame 5 + Offset 64
Cache Access → L1 miss → L2 miss → Memory

Process 1:
Virtual Address: 0x0040
Page Table Hit → Same Physical Frame
Cache Access → L1 hit

Process 2:
Virtual Address: 0x01A0
Page Number: 6
Page Fault → Page loaded into Frame 2
Cache Access → L1 miss → L2 miss → Memory
