Correctness Criteria

Memory Allocation:
- Allocated memory + free memory must equal total memory.
- Freed blocks must be merged with adjacent free blocks.
- Allocation strategies must follow their respective policies:
  - First Fit: first suitable free block
  - Best Fit: smallest suitable free block
  - Worst Fit: largest suitable free block

Fragmentation:
- External fragmentation must increase when free memory is split.
- External fragmentation must decrease after block coalescing.
- Internal fragmentation is minimal due to exact block sizing.

Cache Simulation:
- First access to a new address must result in a cache miss.
- Repeated access to the same address must result in a cache hit.
- On cache miss, access time must include lower-level cache or memory latency.
- Write-through policy must update memory on every write.

Statistics:
- Hit and miss counters must reflect actual access behavior.
- Average Memory Access Time must be correctly computed.
